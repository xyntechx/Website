                My passion lies in the unique union of engineering and public
                policy in technology, my ultimate mission being to shape tech
                for public good. As an undergraduate researcher at the Center
                for Human-Compatible AI, I study and design action abstractions
                to improve the optimality, reliability, and efficiency of
                black-box planning agents. I'm also currently conducting
                independent research (advised by UC Berkeley professors) in the
                intersection of AI and education with the aim of realizing
                personalized education. In the policy sphere, I'm primarily
                interested in analyzing policies in safe and responsible AI,
                making efforts to ensure that these policies are established on
                well-founded ground. For my talent and passion in technology,
                leadership, and public service, I've been awarded the
                prestigious Smart Nation Scholarship by GovTech Singapore to
                pursue my undergraduate studies in Electrical Engineering &
                Computer Sciences (EECS) and Public Policy at UC Berkeley.
