                I'm an engineer and entrepreneur committed to building
                community-driven technological solutions. My desire to make a
                positive difference using tech drove me to study Electrical
                Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) at UC Berkeley. For my
                talent and passion in technology, leadership, and public
                service, I've also been awarded the full-ride Smart Nation
                Scholarship by Singapore's Government Technology Agency.

                I've always loved making stuff, from manga to password-locked
                pencil cases. In late 2018, a bus advertisement on game
                development inspired me to learn coding. After building many
                different projects in many different tech subfields - ML, AR/VR,
                web dev - I found that tech is what enables me to be the most
                creative, to make the most stuff.

                Outside of tech, I love to play volleyball, boulder, and draw
                manga!
